// SOLUTION 1 - implement 'ClosedRange' interface

// We are using the "compareTo" method on the "MyDate" class above
// "start" hides member of supertype "ClosedRange" and needs "override" modifier
// we are using the "contains" method on ClosedRange
// this is called making OUR class "DateRage" IMPLEMENT the "ClosedRange" INTEFACE
// from the standard library
class DateRange1(override val start: MyDate, override val endInclusive: MyDate): ClosedRange<MyDate>



// SOLUTION 2 â€“ add our own "contains" method

// We are using the "compareTo" method on the "MyDate" class above
// "start" hides member of supertype "ClosedRange" and needs "override" modifier
class DateRange(val start: MyDate, val endInclusive: MyDate) {
    // this was the error I got:
    // "operator" modifier is required on "contains"
    operator fun contains(d: MyDate): Boolean = start <= d && d <= endInclusive
